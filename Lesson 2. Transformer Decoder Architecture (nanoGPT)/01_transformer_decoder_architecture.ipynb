    "1. **Stabilizing Activations**: NN layers naturally tend to increase the variance of activations as you go deeper. LayerNorm re-centers and re-scales these activations, preventing values from exploding.\n",
    "2. **Gradient Flow**: By using residual connections `x = x + sublayer(norm(x))`, the \"original\" signal `x` has a direct path to the output. The sub-layers only calculate \"incremental updates\" to this signal.\n",

    "   - **LN1**: Prepares the data for **Spatial Communication** (Attention). It ensures that tokens are comparing themselves on a normalized scale.\n",
    "   - **LN2**: Prepares the data for **Individual Computation** (MLP). It ensures the MLP receives stable input for its nonlinear transformations."
